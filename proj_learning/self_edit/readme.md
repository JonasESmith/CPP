* This is really goofy!
    * But I wanted to create a simple program that when I ran it, it would insert code into another .cpp file
    * to run this program simply
        * ` g++ .\compiler.cpp -o compiler `
        * ` ./compiler `
        * then, run
        * ` g++ .\main.cpp -o main `
        * ` ./main `
